Like most people on the autism spectrum (and many neuro- typicals, a term for people who don\u2019t have a diag- nosed developmental disorder), she struggles with stress when unpredictable things happen.  Tonight we are looking at what happened to her emotional arousal as measured by a wristband that gathers three signals \u2013 skin conductance, motion, and tem- perature (Fig. 1). Jodie was upset to learn that the event she was supposed to speak at was delayed from 8:00 to 8:30pm. She started pacing until her friend told her \u201cStop pacing, that doesn\u2019t help you.\u201d Many people don\u2019t have an accurate read on what they are feeling (this is part of a condition known as alexithymia) and while she thought pacing helped, she wasn\u2019t certain.  So, she took his advice. She then started to make repetitive movements often seen in autism called \u201cstimming,\u201d and continued these until the event began at 8:30. In Fig. 1 we see her skin conductance on the top graph, going down when she was pacing, up when she was stimming, and hitting its highest peaks while she presents.  The level also stays high afterward during other peo- ple\u2019s presentations, when she stayed up front to handle problems with the audio-visual technology, including loud audio feedback. J",

Powerful new insights and changes can be achieved with these abilities.  For example, Jodie collected her emotional arousal data wearing a stretchy wristband, clicked to upload it into a mobile viewer, and showed it to her friend (the one who had asked her to stop pacing).  The first words spoken after checking the time stamps on the data display were his. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you to stop pacing anymore.\u201d The next morn- ing I saw the two of them again.  This time, she was pacing and he sat quietly nearby letting her pace, typing on his laptop. The ability to communicate objective data related to her emotional arousal and activity \u2013 specifically her sympathetic nervous sys- tem activation of which skin conductance is a sensi- tive measure, prompted a change in his behavior. Mind you, she had told him in the moment of stress that she thought pacing was helping, but this did not change his behavior.

Shared happiness is usually a positive experience, and smart to elicit.  However, we recently learned that while 90% of participants expressing delight made this facial expression, so too did 90% of participants in a frustration-eliciting scenario who reported feeling significant frustra- tion.  While it might be intelligent to respond to a delighted smile with one of your own, it is probably not intelligent to appear delighted when your col- laborator is frustrated if you want him to like you.

We labored to build computer vision systems that could see like people see, and learned to build banks of filters, for example, that could detect high- contrast oriented regions and motions in ways that seemed to be similar to stages of the human visual cortex.  Much engineering, whether for vision, or earlier in my life for computer architectures, was focused on trying to replicate the amazing human cortex.  We wanted to figure it out by building it. But nowhere did any of the findings about the hu- man visual cortex address a problem I wanted to answer:  How do you find what is interesting for a person?  How do you find what matters to them? How do visual attention systems figure this out and shift automatically when they need to shift?  Build- ing a vision system is not just about detecting high- contrast oriented lines or telling a dog from a cat. Vision is affected by attention, and attention is af- fected by what matters to you.

From human vision research on perception, we all understood perception to be driven by the cortex \u2013 the visual cortex for vision, the auditory cortex for audition, etc.  But one Christmas break, while reading Richard Cytowic\u2019s \u201cThe Man who Tasted Shapes,\u201d I was jolted out of my cortex- centric focus.  In synesthesia, such as when a person feels shapes in his palms when tasting soup, or sees colors with letters involuntarily or other crossed perceptual modalities, the cortex was observed to be showing less activity, not more.",

I was interested in attention and memory. I started to read more neuroscience literature about these limbic regions.  I was not interested in emo- tion. Alas, I found that the third role\u2013 emotion \u2013 kept coming up as essential in perception.  Emotion biased what we saw and heard.  Emotion played major roles not only in perception, but also in many other aspects of intelligence that AI researchers had been trying to solve from a cortical-centric perspec- tive.  Emotion was vital in forming memory and at- tention and in rational decision-making.  And, of course, emotion communication was vital in hu- man-machine interaction.  Emotions influence ac- tion selection, language, and whether or not you decide to double-check your mathematical deriva- tions, comment your computer code, initiate a con- versation, or read some of the stories below.",

While the phrase is widely accepted today, at the time it was an oxymoron. Goleman\u2019s popular writing did a lot to interest the general public in the important roles emotions play in many areas of success in life \u2013 he argued it was more important than verbal and mathematical in- telligences, which of course was what AI research- ers had been focused on.  The topic of emotion was starting to get more respect, although for some rea- son it was still very hard to get computer scientists to take it seriously.",

It was kind of a stretch to find some science given the booming sounds in the vac- uum of outer space, and more.  But, I did confirm that the character of Spock had emotion.  Spock was not emotionally expressive and kept emotion under control, but it was important to claim that he still had emotion, deep inside, in order for his intelligent functioning to be scientifically accurate.  If he really didn\u2019t have emotion, and behaved as intelligently as he behaved, then it would have been bad science in the show.  The actor Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock, later came to MIT and hosted a big event I chaired featuring new technology measuring and communicating emotional signals.  He ap- peared remarkably unemotional, even when he was not playing Spock.  I tried to convince him that he could show emotion and still be intelligent.  He still showed almost no emotion, but his presence at- tracted more people to come and learn about why my group was developing affective technologies.",
