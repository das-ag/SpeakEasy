Your message should have one main point or thought -- two at the most. Take time to craft your message before you post it, writing a first draft and then editing it down to the most essential components. Format your message in short paragraphs, bullets, headings, etc. to make it easier to read on the screen. Avoid composing directly in the message board because that leads to \"stream of conscience\" writing. Your starter message may be longer than follow-up messages, because it lays out your thinking.
