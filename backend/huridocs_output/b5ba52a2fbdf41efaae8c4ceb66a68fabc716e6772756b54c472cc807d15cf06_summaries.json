To overcome this, they strategically incorporated keywords like \"Digital processing,\" \"Signal processing,\" and \"machine intelligence\" in paper titles to align with conference and journal themes, successfully gaining acceptance at venues like ICASSP and PAMI.  However, even with strategic titling, their first PAMI paper on affective computing underwent a rigorous review process with five reviewers before publication.", "text": "However, when I submitted my first careful- ly written technical emotion recognition paper fo- cusing on physiological pattern analysis to the IEEE conference on \u201ccomputer vision and pattern analy- sis (CVPR)\u201d the reviewers wrote \u201cthe topic does not fit into CVPR since it doesn\u2019t have any computer vision in it.\u201d Later I strategically put \u201cDigital pro- cessing of\u2026\u201d and \u201cSignal processing for\u2026\u201d in the titles of papers submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Pro- cessing and they got accepted.  This same trick worked to get past the \u201cit doesn\u2019t fit\u201d excuses for our first IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence paper on affective computing as well:  I put \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d in the title.  Of course it was not that easy: the editor also insisted that five thorough reviewers iterate with me before approv- ing the paper.  Usually three will suffice.  I had been an associate editor of PAMI and seen a lot of re- views, but never seen any set of such length as re- quired for this first paper on emotion.  I addressed every comment and the paper got published.", "page": 9, "bbox": []}, "seg_91": {"summary": "Summary: Early on, the author faced rejection of their affective computing paper from ACM, who deemed it outside of traditional human-computer interaction themes, possibly due to its focus on emotion.  Despite this initial resistance and feeling that emotion was unwelcome, the author is now surprised and pleased to see the widespread acceptance of affective computing at conferences.  This highlights the significant shift in the field's perception of emotion in computing.", "text": "By the way, it was not just the IEEE \u2013 the ACM also rejected my first affective computing submis- sion as \u201cnot matching any of the topics or themes in the human-computer area.\u201d I wondered from the review if they had even read the paper or just re- jected it when they saw it addressed emotion. Years later I was delighted when several affective topics were added to their official themes.  To this day, I still feel slightly amazed when I see conferences that openly solicit affective topics even though Af- fective Computing has its own international confer- ence now and many other conferences also openly solicit affective computing work.  It wasn\u2019t always that way \u2013 in the beginning, emotion was really fringe, unwelcome, and the few people working on", "page": 9, "bbox": []}}
